\f0\fs24 \cf0 I want to built a ml model using cursor, which model of cursor ai should I use to do the same.\
give me best prompt to give to cursor ai for creating a Ml model. \
the problem statement is - \
"In competitive markets, businesses struggle to design marketing strategies that effectively target customers. Without understanding customer personality traits, marketing campaigns risk being generic, resulting in lower engagement and conversion rates. This project aims to leverage advanced machine learning models to predict customer personality profiles based on demographic, behavioral, and purchase history data. The predictions will help businesses tailor personalized marketing strategies to maximize customer satisfaction and revenue.\
Objective -\
Develop a machine learning model to predict customer personality traits from available business data.\
Improve marketing campaign effectiveness through targeted personalization.\
Provide actionable insights for marketing teams to optimize customer engagement strategies\
Methodology (Full ML Lifecycle + Deployment)\
\uc0\u55357 \u56549  Data Collection\
Use publicly available datasets containing demographic, behavioral, and transaction data.\
\uc0\u55357 \u56522  Data Preprocessing\
Handle missing values and outliers.\
Encode categorical features and normalize numerical data.\
\uc0\u9881  Feature Engineering\
Extract derived features like purchase frequency, spending patterns, and brand preferences.\
\uc0\u55358 \u56598  Model Development\
Train models: Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Neural Networks.\
Optimize hyperparameters via grid search or Bayesian optimization.\
\uc0\u55358 \u56810  Evaluation\
Measure performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.\
Perform stratified k-fold cross-validation.\
\uc0\u55357 \u56960  Deployment\
Integrate predictions into a CRM dashboard for marketing teams.\
